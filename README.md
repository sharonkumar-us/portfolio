# Portfolio Page

This is a simple, responsive portfolio template you can customize.

Files:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styles (variables at the top)
- script.js — small interactivity (theme toggle, form demo)
- assets/ — place images, resume PDF, and other static files here

Quick start:
1. Replace the placeholder text, project entries, and social links in `index.html`.
2. Put your photo at `assets/avatar.jpg` or update the markup.
3. Replace the resume link `assets/Sharon-Kumar-Resume.pdf` with your actual resume.
4. Hook the contact form to your backend or a form service (Netlify Forms, Formspree, etc.), or keep the mailto link.

Deploy:
- Host on GitHub Pages by pushing to a repository and enabling Pages.
- Or use Vercel / Netlify for easy deployments.

Customization ideas:
- Replace project cards with dynamic JSON and load them via JS.
- Add a CMS (Sanity, Contentful) or use a static site generator (Next.js, Eleventy).
- Improve accessibility audits using Lighthouse or axe.

Made for quick iteration — edit freely and make it yours!
